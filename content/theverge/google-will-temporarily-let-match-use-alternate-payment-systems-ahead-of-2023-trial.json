Both companies are set to go to trial in April 2023. Google says it plans on filing a countersuit against Match for allegedly breaching its Developer Distribution Agreement in the meantime.</p><p id=\"O2wjcl\">Just like Match, the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/2/22958416/epic-games-bandcamp-music-store-acquisition\">Epic Games-owned Bandcamp</a> is also entrenched in a legal battle against Google. Last month, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/29/23048059/epic-games-google-bandcamp-play-store\">Epic filed a motion for a preliminary injunction</a> to prevent Google from taking the music storefront off of its app store for using its own billing system.</p><p id=\"WE3YGr\">On Friday, <a href=\"https://blog.bandcamp.com/2022/04/29/supporting-artists-on-android/\">Bandcamp announced</a> that it reached an agreement similar to the one Match made with Google, which also allows Bandcamp to stay on the Google Play Store while using its own payment system. The music platform says it will place 10 percent of its proceeds from purchases made on Android in an escrow fund until <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust\">Epic’s broader antitrust lawsuit against Google</a> moves forward. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367963/epic-fortnite-legal-complaint-apple-ios-app-store-removal-injunctive-relief\">Epic launched a similar lawsuit against Apple</a> in 2020 after the company <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments\">removed <em>Fortnite</em> from the App Store</a> for using an alternate billing system — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown\">the final ruling</a> determined <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667769/apple-epic-lost-lawsuit-verdict-ruling\">no real winner</a>.</p><aside id=\"IN29Xo\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Spotify might soon bypass Android billing, but Google’s still getting paid\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22993765/google-spotify-android-user-choice-billing\"},{\"title\":\"EU targets Big Tech with sweeping new antitrust legislation \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/24/22994234/eu-antitrust-legislation-dma-digital-markets-act-details\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"rJLFmg\">Match Group and Epic Games are both members of the <a href=\"https://appfairness.org/\">Coalition of App Fairness</a> (CAF), a group of companies that fight against policies it views as anticompetitive, including Google and Apple’s rules that discourage developers from using alternate payment processors on their respective app stores. In March, Google announced that Spotify — another CAF member — would become the first platform to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/23/22993417/google-pilot-test-android-alternate-billing-systems-spotify\">test using its own payment system</a> (in addition to Google’s) on the Play Store.</p><p id=\"MTzAjB\">Google and Apple have come under fire for their app store policies by both developers and government regulators in various countries. In February, the Senate Judiciary Committee passed <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22914479/open-app-markets-act-legislation-senate-committee-markup-explained\">the Open App Markets Act</a>, a bill geared toward promoting competition in mobile computing, while the EU is set to enforce its own <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/8/23062666/eu-start-enforcing-the-dma-digital-markets-act-spring-2023-big-tech-regulation\">set of laws to regulate Big Tech</a> in spring 2023. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/28/22999998/apple-bigger-fine-proposal-dutch-regulator-acm-netherlands-dating-apps\">The Netherlands has also taken issue</a> with Apple’s in-app payment policies, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes\">South Korea has enacted legislation</a> requiring both Google and Apple to let developers use third-party payment systems in their apps.</p><div id=\"wDrjIR\"><iframe src=\"https://embed.documentcloud.org/documents/22028601-match_google_stipulation_proposed_order/?embed=1&amp;responsive=1&amp;title=1\" title=\"Match_Google_stipulation_proposed_order (Hosted by DocumentCloud)\" width=\"700\" height=\"905\"  sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox\"></iframe></div><p id=\"qs3QOD\"></p><p id=\"0XJVv7\"></p>",
