Teeing off first is the Google Nest Wifi mesh router system. Wellbots has a few different configurations of the Nest Wifi available with special discounts, including <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dwifi&amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals052122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the standalone router for just $119</a> ($50 off when you use code <strong>50VERGE </strong>at checkout), the <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dwifi%3Fvariant%3D32156566093872&amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals052122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">router and one additional Point to extend the mesh network for $189</a> ($80 off with code <strong>80VERGE</strong>), and the <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dwifi%3Fvariant%3D32156566192176&amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals052122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">router plus two Points for $249</a> ($100 off with code <strong>100VERGE</strong>).</p><p id=\"UXjxLQ\">The important thing here is to pick the right setup for your home depending on how much space you need to cover. The Nest Wifi router by itself is rated to cover up to 2,200 square feet, and adding just one Point to the mix extends that to 3,800. A home with a tricky layout or thicker walls may benefit from a Point or two to extend the mesh network, even if it’s not massive space. There’s a further benefit to adding a Point to the equation — each one acts as a smart speaker for playing music, podcasts, and accessing the Google Assistant. So when it comes down to picking which of these Wi-Fi 5-capable setups is just right for you, consider the factors of coverage, convenience, and cost that are right for you. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features\"><strong>Read our review.</strong></a></p><div id=\"JK4AGd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10306054\"></div></div><p id=\"tP2N0d\">There’s a great deal happening on 1Password’s subscription of services. New customers can sign up for one year of 1Password’s password manager service and get <a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15224370\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent off an individual plan</a> or <a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15224371\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">50 percent off a family plan</a>. Both are billed annually, with the family plan offering especially good value if you require more than one account. </p><p id=\"nfx9pH\">The <a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15224370\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">individual plan deal gets you one personal account with access across unlimited devices that costs just $17.94 for the first year</a> of service, as opposed to the regular $36. As for the <a href=\"http://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-15224371\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">family plan, you get five accounts for $30 for the first year</a> instead of the usual $60. We’ve seen these 1Password deals drop as low as 60 percent off before, so while this one is not the very best it comes pretty close. If you’re in need of protecting your personal data with an easy way to generate secure passwords (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/24/15921282/best-password-manager-1password-lastpass-dashlane-how-to\">and we all are</a>), it’s a good way to go.</p><aside id=\"laVZBN\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best free password manager\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"1bdPPa\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10426335\"></div></div><div id=\"erKbdB\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10437502\"></div></div><p id=\"zvo99B\">If you’ve got an Xbox Series X or Series S and you like to keep lots of games installed at once, their built-in storage can start to feel a lot more limiting than it sounds on paper at first. Many AAA-titles are 60GB or more each, with some like <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> taking up nearly 100GB on its own. Yes, you <em>can </em>plug in a USB hard drive and offload some games into cold storage, but they have to moved back to the internal SSD when it’s time to play. </p><p id=\"BLXsL7\">So, if you really want more storage, the 2TB Xbox Expansion Card from Seagate, which usually runs $399.99, is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BJYXMDW?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently discounted to $380.90 at Amazon</a>. I know that is still a pretty penny for 2,000GB (or roughly 21 more copies of <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em>), but these little expansion cards rarely go on sale. They’re also just as fast as the internal storage of the Xbox Series X and S, and they plug into the rear of the console — so there’s no ugly USB cable and disc drive sitting alongside your Xbox. </p><div id=\"eYRt91\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10978830\"></div></div><p id=\"EJMx5h\">Planning a fun getaway or excursion for the upcoming Memorial Day Weekend holiday? If you want something to help you record some memories while doing fun, outdoorsy activities, the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FPCYMD6?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GoPro Hero 10 Black with an additional battery and a dual battery charger is down to $399.99</a> at Amazon.</p><p id=\"IBXteg\">This is the latest action camera from GoPro, and while it looks a lot like the previous Hero 9, it’s much faster, thanks to its GP2 processor. The Hero 10 Black captures up to 5.3K 60fps footage and even 120fps slow-mo at 4K resolution. It also maintains that front-facing screen from its predecessor, so framing up your shot when mounting the camera on something like a bike is much easier. One of the few drawbacks to the Hero 10 is its mediocre battery life, but that’s one of the reasons this deal is so great — for about $400 you get an extra battery included, as well as a dual charger to easily keep both packs topped-up and ready. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"GEfE4A\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10884792\"></div></div><h2 id=\"S0IvHq\">A few more deals to round out your weekend:</h2><ul><li id=\"bKzgM4\">In addition to our Google Nest deals at the top, <a href=\"https://shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=1264455&amp;u=1225169&amp;m=83747&amp;urllink=www%2Ewellbots%2Ecom%2Fproducts%2Fgoogle%2Dnest%2Dhub%2Dmax&amp;afftrack=vergedailydeals052122\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wellbots is also discounting the Nest Hub Max 10-inch smart display down to $179</a> ($50 off its usual price of $229 with code <strong>50VERGE</strong> at checkout).
