Now, it’s launching its new XR2-powered reference AR glasses so hardware manufacturers can “enable immersive experiences that unlock the metaverse.” But if we look beyond the marketing speak, the company’s new headset has gone wireless with a sleeker design. What does the new headset offer? The firm says it has a 40% thinner profile than the XR1 reference design, and has equal weight distribution for wearing it comfortably for a longer time. What’s more, these glasses — designed by Goertek — weigh just 115 grams.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/qualcomm-ar-glasses-reference-design-analysis?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
