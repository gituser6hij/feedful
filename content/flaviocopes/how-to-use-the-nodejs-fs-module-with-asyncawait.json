  "description": "Node.js built-in modules famously are not promise-based.\nThis is for historical reasons, as those modules were created before promises were a thing.\nWe’ve had promisify for quite some time, but I recently found out Node.js provides a new API that’s promise-based.\nI thought it was new but it’s been introduced in Node.js 10 (2018, it’s been a while!).\nAt the moment it only works for the fs built-in module.\nI’m not sure if this will be ported to other native modules soon.",
